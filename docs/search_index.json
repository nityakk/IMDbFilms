Since years, this industry has provided the society with variety of media content be it in form of TV series, movies, or short videos. These content are meant to not only entertain the user base but also educate them through releasing the video content of different genres such as Comedy, Crime, Suspense, Education to name a few. It is specifically noteworthy that such content knows no barrier and allows the users to watch any movie/video/TV series in different languages produced basically to target groups of people that belongs to specific regions. While the users enjoys and consumes these contents at anytime and anywhere through any platform they desire, it is undeniably appreciated that it is possible only through the hard work and passion of many crew members behind it, for instance, the directors and writers of the video content. It is extremely important for these people to learn and understand how does their users respond to the content that they produce. The most obvious way they can know this is through the ratings and number of votes they receive from the people that watch their films, series, and so on. Apart from this, the ratings of any movie, show, or other such content can help to study any kind of trend that prevails in this industry. The goal of our project is to work around similar objectives and study several trends that can be observed in the film entertainment sector. For this purpose we have utilized the IMDb Datasets collected from the IMDb official website. We have implemented several visualizations in form statics as well as interactive charts to explore different relationships or trends present in the dataset. We will perform the exploratory data visualization and analysis to find answers to the following questions: 1. Did the number of releases of titles that contained adult content started increasing with the progressing years? Further, is there relation or trend in the proportion of votes received by adult titles versus non-adult titles over the given period of years? 2. What is the distribution of the average ratings for different genres? Furthermore, for the highet rated genre, how does its average ratings vary from one title type to another? 3. For top 10 pairs of directors and writers who have worked most of the time with each other, how does the weighted average rating for different title types that they have produced? Moreover, for the director-writer pairs who have worked more than 5 times together and have produced content with a weighted average rating of 10, what is the trend in the distribution of number of votes that they received for their different title types such as videos, TV series, shorts, and others. In the following chapters, we will address the above questions through carrying out detailed visualization and analysis tasks. For more details on the code portion of this project, please click here.

These datasets are updated on a daily basis. They are also quite dense and contain both categorical and continuous variables. Among all the available datasets on the above link, we collected and used three datasets for our project: title.basics.tsv.gz, title.crew.tsv.gz, and title.ratings.tsv.gz. Moreover, we have also merged and manipulated these datasets based on our requirements to address the said objectives. We Each team member of our was responsible to collect the data. We simply downloaded it from the said link and then unzipped it to be accessed for this project. We chose to use the three datasets mentioned above as we firmly thought that they contained the information that was relevant to answer the questions that we were interested to investigate. The detailed information about the datasets that we used is described below: 2.1 Basics title.basics.tsv.gz This dataset provides the basic information about different contents as displayed below: 1. tconst (string) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title 2. ttlTy (string) – the type/format of the title (e.g. movie, short, tvseries, tvepisode, video, etc) 3. prmrT (string) – the more popular title / the title used by the filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release 4. orgnT (string) - original title, in the original language 5. isAdl (boolean) - 0: non-adult title; 1: adult title 6. strtY (YYYY) – represents the release year of a title. In the case of TV Series, it is the series start year 7. endYr (YYYY) – TV Series end year. ‘’ for all other title types 8. rntmM – primary runtime of the title, in minutes 9. genrs (string array) – includes up to three genres associated with the title basics &lt;- read.csv(&quot;sources/title.basics.tsv&quot;, sep = &#39;\\t&#39;, header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, na.strings = &quot;NA&quot;) basics[basics == &quot;\\\\N&quot;] &lt;- NA head(basics, 5) ## tconst titleType primaryTitle originalTitle isAdult ## 1 tt0000001 short Carmencita Carmencita 0 ## 2 tt0000002 short Le clown et ses chiens Le clown et ses chiens 0 ## 3 tt0000003 short Pauvre Pierrot Pauvre Pierrot 0 ## 4 tt0000004 short Un bon bock Un bon bock 0 ## 5 tt0000005 short Blacksmith Scene Blacksmith Scene 0 ## startYear endYear runtimeMinutes genres ## 1 1894 &lt;NA&gt; 1 Documentary,Short ## 2 1892 &lt;NA&gt; 5 Animation,Short ## 3 1892 &lt;NA&gt; 4 Animation,Comedy,Romance ## 4 1892 &lt;NA&gt; 12 Animation,Short ## 5 1893 &lt;NA&gt; 1 Comedy,Short The potential columns that we will use from this datatset are titleType, isAdult, startYear, and genres of different contents. These information will help us answer all the objective questions that we have formulated. The variable types for all the columns above is character, which we will actually convert in different relevant datatypes that would help us answer our questions. Moreover, there are a total of 8486592 rows, that is, 8.4 million rows and 9 columns in the basics dataset. 2.2 Crew title.crew.tsv.gz This dataset gives information on directors and writers for each content type produced. The description of the columns contained in this dataset is as below: 1. tcnst (string) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title 2. drctr (array of nconsts) - director(s) of the given title 3. wrtrs (array of nconsts) – writer(s) of the given title crew &lt;- read.csv(&quot;sources/title.crew.tsv&quot;, sep = &#39;\\t&#39;, header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, na.strings = &quot;NA&quot;) crew[crew == &quot;\\\\N&quot;] &lt;- NA head(crew, 5) ## tconst directors writers ## 1 tt0000001 nm0005690 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 tt0000002 nm0721526 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 tt0000003 nm0721526 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 tt0000004 nm0721526 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 tt0000005 nm0005690 &lt;NA&gt; We will make use of all the columns from this dataset to address the question 3 for our project. The default datatype of the columns above is character. Quantitatively, there are 8486594, that is, 8.4 million rows and 3 columns in the crew dataset. 2.3 Ratings title.ratings.tsv.gz This dataset basically gives the average ratings as well as the number of votes for each title. We may need to normalize this dataset as ratings can be skewed heavily if they have too little votes. The columns contained in this dataset are as follows: 1. tcnst (string) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title 2. avrgR – weighted average of all the individual user ratings 3. nmVts - number of votes the title has received ratings &lt;- read.csv(&quot;sources/title.ratings.tsv&quot;, sep = &#39;\\t&#39;, header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, na.strings = &quot;NA&quot;) ratings[ratings == &quot;\\\\N&quot;] &lt;- NA head(ratings, 5) ## tconst averageRating numVotes ## 1 tt0000001 5.7 1842 ## 2 tt0000002 6.0 237 ## 3 tt0000003 6.5 1604 ## 4 tt0000004 6.0 154 ## 5 tt0000005 6.2 2423 Potentially, we will utilize all the columns of this datatset to answer all the 3 questions of our project. The variable type of the columns in this dataset is character, double, and integer respecively for tconst, averageRating, and numVotes variables. There are 1191702, that is, 1.1 million rows and 3 columns in the ratings dataset. "],["chapter-3-data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Transformations to study distribution trends in Adult v/s Non-Adult titles 3.2 Transformations to study the distributions of genre 3.3 Transformations to study the performance of different director-writer pairs", " Chapter 3 Chapter 3 Data transformation We are working around three dataset in total, that is, titles.basics, title.crew, title.ratings. Therefore, it was very necessary to transformation the individual overall datasets by merging different datasets, adding new columns or removing the ones that were not needed or that had any NULL values. Below, we describe the transformations that we incorporated which were necessary to accomplish the results of different questions. 3.1 Transformations to study distribution trends in Adult v/s Non-Adult titles This question basically addresses two objectives. - The first part studies the trend of number of adult title releases with the change of time. - The second part studies the proportion of votes distribution of adult versus non-adult titles over the given period of time. For this question, we primarily use the title.basics and title.ratings dataset. Therefore, we will initially prepare a new auxiliary dataframe which contains transformed version of these datasets. 3.1.1 Adult title releases trends In this part of the first objective question we wish to observe that with progressing years, did the film industry started making more adults, or less adults, or was the number of releases constant. The following steps show a detailed explanation on how we transformed the data step by step: - Among all the columns available in the title.basics dataset, we are only interested in using the ‘startYear’ and ‘isAdult’ columns to achieve the first part of the first objective question. Thus, we dropped the other available columns in the data which were unnecessary for our exploration, likewise, ‘primaryTitle’, ‘originalTitle’, ‘endYear’, ‘runtimeMinutes’ and formed a new auxiliary dataframe named ‘basics_ratings’. - Further, as mentioned earlier, we need the necessary information(‘startYear’ and ‘isAdult’) from title.basics, which basically is the basics_ratings dataframe, and title.ratings data combined in one auxiliary dataframe. So, we merge the title.ratings dataset with the basics_ratings dataframe and use to address both first and second part of the first objective question. -Moreover, we analyzed that there were missing values in the ‘isAdult’ and ‘startYear’ columns. As we are going to explore that with the progress of year does the number of adult movies released had any trend or not, so we need to remove the start years values that have NULL. Also, we are summing up the total number of adult titles released per year, therefore, it is necessary to delete the rows that have NA values for isAdult. Thus, we dropped the rows which either contained NULL values for startYear or NULL values for isAdult. - After cleaning the data by adding, removing and merging the columns, the next step is to group similar start years together and calculate the total number of adult titles that were released in that particular year. For this grouping operation to execute, we converted the datatype of both ‘startYear’ and ‘isAdult’ columns to numeric. Once the datatype was transformed in the desired format, we grouped similar years together based on two different conditions: -Grouped same years and calculated the sum of the isAdult column which gave the total number of adult titles released in a particular year. We assigned this to a new temporary dataframe. -Grouped same years and counted the number of rows of the isAdult column which gave the total number of titles released in a particular in a particular year irrespective of adult or non-adult. We assigned this to another new temporary dataframe. Finally, we merged the above two temporary dataframes into one by the grouped start years. - As the last step, we calculated the proportion of the adult titles released per start year. This percent would then be used to plot it against their respective start years and study the trend. 3.1.2 Ratings distribution of non-adult vs adult titles In this part of the first objective question, we are basically studying that did the non-adult titles released more percentages of votes, or less percentages of votes, or same as compared to the votes received by the adult titles in particular year. The following steps explains the transformations that we followed: - First, we filtered out the rows from the basics_ratings dataset that had information about the non-adult titles and stored them in a new temporary auxiliary dataframe. Similarily, we filtered out the rows from the basics_ratings dataset that had information about the adult titles and stored them in another new temporary auxiliary dataframe. - Further, we merged the above two temporary dataframes together into one based on similar start years and calculated the sum of the number of votes that were received by non adult and adult titles respectively. These two sums were basically created as two different new columns. - Next we merged the above two columns based on start year to form a new transformed dataframe. Moreover, while merging there was a case when there would be some years which were not present in non adult titles or vice versa. So, performed a detailed transformation that included the start years from both the columns and not just the common years. In this situation, the rows that would result in NA values for the number of votes were transformed to get replaced by 0. - Finally, we calculated a new column ‘non-adult’ in the merged dataframe above that contained the proportion of titles that were non-adult type for the particular year. Similarly, we created another new column in the merged dataframe above that contained the proportion of titles that were adult type for that particular year. These two columns would be used to plot against the start year and study that among the total votes received per year, how much percentage of votes were for non-adult titles and how much were for adult. 3.2 Transformations to study the distributions of genre Our second objective question studies how different genres vary in terms of votes, title type, and ratings. We would like to know which genres tend to recieve the most attention and how the type of work has an affect on ratings even within the most popular genre. As the dataset is very large, we decided to subset the dataset based on works done by experience directors. We have defined experience as those directors who have completed at least 20 works. By subsetting this way, we are also looking at top works within the dataset. The limitation with subsetting in this manner is that we may be losing data on works created by directors who are experienced but do not show up in the dataset at least 20 times. Our transformations are as follows: - First we filtered out all of the titles that were not created by experienced directors. The remaining titles were grouped by title type, and genre. A new column was added for weighted ratings (ratings weighted by number of votes) and total number of votes. Any potential rows with missing values were dropped. - To see how different genres compare with each other, we first obtained all unique genres. Many of the rows in the genre column had comma separated values. However, there were some rows that had singular genre names. It can be noted that a list of all singular genre names represents the unique genre names. For each unique genre name, we obtained the total number of times the genre appears (within both singular and comma separated row values) and the average rating of all of the works within that genre. We also grouped this dataset based on title type to see what the distribution across title types looks like. - Due to the large size of the data, it is difficult to view trends within each genre. Therefore, we decided to specifically look at the most popular genre. After visualizing the comparison of different genres (seen in Chapter 5.2), we concluded that the most popular genre is “Drama”. Therefore, we subset our previous dataset of works by experienced directors by works that have “Drama” as at least one of the genre types. This was again grouped as earlier (grouped by title type, and genre, with the addition of total votes and weighted averages). 3.3 Transformations to study the performance of different director-writer pairs The question basically addresses two problems - The first part studies the top 10 director - writer pairs based on the number of times they worked together. Further, these pairs are used to study the distribution of average ratings of different title types they have produced. - The second part studies that out of all the director writer pairs having average rating of 10, what is the distribution of the num of Votes for those particular pairs faceted by titleType. For addressing the first question mentioned above we need to perform the following transformations: - First, we filtered out the rows from the basics_ratings_crew dataset that had NA for writers and directors. We wanted to study the different director writer pairs so it was important that the dataset had no NULL values for either of these variables. - Furthermore, for making the pair we used the paste function for concatenating the director column with writer column to form new column named director_writer_pair. This merging was required as our main aim revolves around studying the director-writer pair and this new columns will ease the upcoming visualization process. - The total unique director writer pairs were approximately 600K. Visualizing all of them is not feasible and the results that they would give would also not be intuitive. Therefore, we decided to pick the top 10 pairs based on the number of times they have worked together. So we calculated the count of all the pairs and then selected the top 10. - Eventually, we filtered the original dataset with the top 10 director writer pairs. For addressing the second question mentioned above we need to perform the following transformations: - To begin with, we used the dataset created for the above question which contained the director writer pairs. Furthermore, we grouped the data by “director_writer_pair”, “titleType”, and “genres” and then summarized the data by calculating the total number of Votes received by the pair for different title types. - Further, we summarized the same grouped data for calculating the weighted rating which is calculated by taking the sum of average rating \\(\\times\\) number of Votes divided by total number of Votes. - Next, we joined both the grouped data to get the weighted rating as well as total number of Votes for a particular director-writer pair. - Finally, we filtered the data by weighted rating in order to get only the pairs having weighted rating equal to 10. We then merged this filtered data with the data having the count of number of times a particular pair worked together. - The final dataset had total of 783 pairs who had average rating of 10 so to further filter the data we studied the distribution of the number of times the pair worked together and found that out of 783, 692 pairs worked with each other only once or twice and therefore we further narrowed the data to only consider the pairs who have worked more than 5 times with each other. ## # A tibble: 603,287 × 4 ## # Groups: director_writer_pair, directors [603,287] ## director_writer_pair directors writers weightedRating ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 nm0000005 - nm0000005 nm0000005 nm0000005 8.06 ## 2 nm0000005 - nm0000005,nm0279027 nm0000005 nm0000005,nm0279027 6.4 ## 3 nm0000005 - nm0000005,nm0340471 nm0000005 nm0000005,nm0340471 7.5 ## 4 nm0000005 - nm0000005,nm0410694 nm0000005 nm0000005,nm0410694 7.5 ## 5 nm0000005 - nm0000005,nm0529508 nm0000005 nm0000005,nm0529508 6.6 ## 6 nm0000005 - nm0000005,nm0845496 nm0000005 nm0000005,nm0845496 6.4 ## 7 nm0000005 - nm0000005,nm1749058 nm0000005 nm0000005,nm1749058 7 ## 8 nm0000005 - nm0051923,nm0000005 nm0000005 nm0051923,nm0000005 7.1 ## 9 nm0000005 - nm0074790 nm0000005 nm0074790 6.2 ## 10 nm0000005 - nm0091112,nm0649636 nm0000005 nm0091112,nm0649636 5.6 ## # … with 603,277 more rows 3.3.1 Interactive Plot ## # A tibble: 4,137 × 4 ## # Groups: titleType [10] ## titleType genres weightedRating totalVotes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 movie Action 5.35 124954 ## 2 movie Action,Adult 4.69 286 ## 3 movie Action,Adult,Adventure 6.6 8 ## 4 movie Action,Adult,Crime 5.37 241 ## 5 movie Action,Adult,Drama 4.66 1196 ## 6 movie Action,Adventure 7.51 3527216 ## 7 movie Action,Adventure,Animation 7.23 1342592 ## 8 movie Action,Adventure,Biography 7.07 684209 ## 9 movie Action,Adventure,Comedy 6.60 8364728 ## 10 movie Action,Adventure,Crime 6.32 1809553 ## # … with 4,127 more rows The above transformation subsets our data by genre and saves each subset as its own file. "],["chapter-4-missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Basics 4.2 Crew 4.3 Ratings", " Chapter 4 Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Basics We studied the percentage of missing values in the ‘title.basics.tsv.gz’ through the graph plotted above. Analysis: 1. It is observed that out of all the total rows, almost ~99% of row are there which does not have the value for the end year of the title. This is followed by ~74% rows where runtime in minutes of the title is not available. Moreover, there are only ~12% and 5% rows respectively that does not contain the values for the start year and genre of the corresponding title. 2. Very insignificant percentage of missing values are observed for columns that provides information if the title is adult or not, what is the primary title name, and original title name. 3. Interestingly, there are no missing values for title type and the alphanumeric constant of the title. 4.Among all the rows that has missing values, majority of the rows has missing values for both end year as well as runtime of the title combined. This constitutes for ~56% rows. 5.Moreover, there are 25% rows which has solely end year missing values, whereas ~12% rows where end year is missing along with runtime and start year of the title. There are minimal percentage of rows which witnesses complete cases, that is, only around 1% of rows has no missing values in them. From this dataset, we have utilized the information about the start year of title, title type, and whether the title is adult or not. Therefore, to handle the missing values of the start year, we have dropped the rows where there were no start year mentioned. Further, to handle the rows with missing values for isAdult or not, we again dropped those rows from the dataset. This detailed information about this transformation is explained in the ‘Data Transforamtion’ chapter. Finally, as there are no missing values for the title type column thus we do not have to worry about it. 4.2 Crew The graph above manifests the percentage of missing data in the ‘title.crew.tsv.gz’ dataset. Analysis: 1. It is observed from the top-most graph that approximately 50% of the total rows in the dataset has missing values for the writers and 40% of the total rows of the dataset contains missing values for the directors. However, the the alphanumeric identifier is present for all the rows irrespective if the writer or director is missing or not. 2. The main graph reveals that there are 4 different patterns in the data, likewise, the rows where: i) only directors are missing, ii) only writers are missing, iii) both writer and directors are missing iv) there are no missing values 3. It is noted from the right-most graph that the percentage of rows where both director and writers are missing is significantly more than the percentage of rows where only director or only writer is missing. 4. It is interpreted that out of the 50% of the rows where writers are missing, there ~37% of the rows where the writers values are missing along with some directors values. Whereas there are only ~13% rows where solely writers are missing. Similarly, out of the 40% of the rows where directors values are missing, there are ~37% rows where the directors are missing along with the writers while only ~3% rows where solely directors values are missing. 5. Notably, a total of 44% of the rows in the dataset have complete cases patterns, meaning there are no missing values in this proportion of rows. We have made use of the ‘title.crew.tsv.gz’ dataset to answer the question 2 and 3 of our objective. We primarily use the director and writer values provided in the above dataset, therefore, it is very necessary to handle the missing values in these columns. To do so, we simply dropped the rows which had the missing values, that is, “NA” values and then utilized the two columns. The detail about this transformation is explained in the ‘Data Transformation’ chapter. 4.3 Ratings The above graph reveals the information about missing values in the ‘title.ratings.tsv.gz’. This dataset contains the following information: Analysis: 1. It is clearly seen that there are no values missing in the ‘title.ratings.tsv.gz’ dataset. There is only 1 pattern found, that is, all the columns of the dataset have complete and consistent values. Therefore, we have 100% complete cases for the average ratings and number of votes for all the titles given in the dataset and there are no missing patterns. We are utilizing the ‘title.ratings.tsv.gz’ majorly to answer all of our objective questions. It is thus observed that we do not have to worry about any missing patterns for this datatset as there are none. "],["chapter-5-results.html", "Chapter 5 Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Adult Works 5.2 Variation of Average Ratings amongst genres 5.3 Best Director-Writer Pairings", " Chapter 5 Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Adult Works 5.1.1 Proportion of Adult movies over time 1. The graph above shows an interesting trend on the proportion of titles that were released and were adult with increasing year. In the late 1800s it was observed that no adult titles were released at all. 2. However, the trend changed in the early 1900s where the number of releases for adult titles started increasing. There were a few rising spikes observed in some of the years between 1905 to 1930; at for example, 1907, 1909, 1914, 1920, and 1924. The highest proportion achieved in the early 1900s was peaked at 1% of the total movie releases of the year 1924. 3. Further, this unstable rise in the proportion of releases of adult titles started declining constantly and immediately became 0% for year between 1930 and 1947. After a few very less proportionate spikes until 1968, the proportion of releases started increasing linearly till 1971 and peaked at ~3.3% in 1971. 4. After 1971, there was a considerable increased proportion of adult title releases in the late 1900s till 1995. However, this increase was quite abrupt as, that is, after decreasing for a year, the trend was witnessed to increase again and reach a new peak at ~4.5% in 1976. Next, after decreasing again for a few years till 1982, it again saw a significant increase till 1984 and reached its maximum peak over the given years at around 6.5% 5. Ultimately, the trend was cumulatively observed to decrease at approximately 0% in 2020. The results overall demonstrates that with progressing years, the proportio of adult movies increased though abruptly. 5.1.2 Comparison of Adult vs Non-Adult movies We have plotted the above graph to comparatively study the proportion of votes received by non adult and adult titles over the given period of time in the dataset. Note that we have used the log() function to calculate and represent the number(proportion) of votes for adult and non adult titles. It is because both of the titles has received number of votes in very separate ranges. Thus, to scale them in a visualizable range we used the log function. 1. The trend for the number of votes received by the adult titles is observed clearly to be similar to the trend observed in the proportion of adult title releases over the same given period of time. That is, adult titles experienced abrupt rises in the number of votes in the early 1900s as compared to 0 number of votes in the late 1800s. In the early 1900s, the number of votes peaked at ~2150 in 1929. 2. Further, it experienced a considerable decrease in the number of votes it received to 0 till 1950 and rised till 128 in 1950. 3. Eventually, the number of votes that adult titles received started increasing very significantly and reached a peak at ~138,000 in 1995. After that, the trend was of a decreasing one till 2020. 4. Contrary to the adult titles, the non adult titles witnessed a clear cumulative increasing trend on the number of votes it received over the given period of time from 1875 till 2020. This linear increase was quite abrupt experiencing minimal declines in the number of votes over the years, however, the overall trend for the number of votes received by non adult titles was increasing. 5.The non adult titles touched a minimum number of votes in 1881 with only 64 number of votes but it was still more than the proportion of votes received by adult titles which was 0. Moreover, it is noteworthy that no adult titles were released around that period. 6. The non adult movies experienced a peak at ~33554432 proportion of votes in 2011 compared to only ~8192 proportion of votes for adult titles. 7. Moreover, the general trend studied for the weighted average rating distribution of adult titles versus non adult titles can interpreted as one where the proportion of votes for non adult titles was always more than the proportion of votes received by adult titles in any given year. 5.2 Variation of Average Ratings amongst genres 5.2.1 Comparing Genres with Weighted Ratings and Number of Works There is an interest in understanding which genres tend to perform better on IMDb ratings. Below we have plotted each genre based on the (i) number of works within that genre in the dataset and (ii) weighted ratings (weighted based on number of votes). 1. The weighted ratings range from 6.0 to 7.2. 2. There doesn’t seem to be a general trend in the data between weighted ratings and number of works. 3. Most of the genres lie below the 700 works line, and much are congregated specifically between the 350-700 works mark. 4. Based on the ‘Weighted Ratings and Number of Works per Genre’ scatterplot, we can see that the genre ‘Documentary’ has the highest weighted rating. ‘Horror’ has the lowest weighted rating which may be due to, given the relatively high number of works, overly-repetitive plot lines. ‘News’ has the lowest number of works. 5. We see that ‘Drama’ has the highest number of votes over all genres with a relatively high rating. This point is of particular interest to us. 6. ‘Drama’ (and ‘Comedy’) are both potential outliers. Based on this plot, ‘Drama’ is a genre that not only has the highest number of works but it also has one of the the highest weighted ratings. It will be interesting to look deeper into the distribution within ‘Drama’. 5.2.2 Comparing Genres Across Different Title Types Using this faceted bar plot, we seek to compare the ‘Drama’ genre across different title types and between genres. Note that the ‘Drama’ genre column is highlighted for ease in comparison. The Movie and tvEpisode title types seem to pull the weight on the large quantity of titles in the full dataset. They typically have over 100 works for each genre in this cleaned dataset. The Game-Show genre has one of the lowest number of works in every single title type. Whereas tvShort and tvSpecial collectively have the least number of works in the dataset. They typically stay to below 100 works. It is evident that overall, the high number of works in the ‘Drama’ genre is not just due to one specific title type and that in almost all title types, the ‘Drama’ genre sticks out with competitive values. The ‘Short’ genre, for example, which expectedly has a high number of works in the short title type but overall lower in other title types. From the previous graph we know that the ‘Short’ genre has an average number of works and rating. The above graph does not allow us to compare weighted ratings in the same way as the values are quite similar. 5.2.3 Deeper Dive - Comparing Different Genre Subtypes To compare the weighted ratings within the ‘Drama’ genre, we have made a cleveland dot plot colored by title type. The lowest rating is in the “Drama, Short, Thriller” category whereas the highest rating is in the ‘Biography, Drama, History’ category. Some genres like “Comedy, Drama, Sport” have very different ratings based on the title type but some like ‘Drama, News, Talk-show’ at the very top have either very few points (in this case causing the point to be at the very top as it is not pulled down by lower ratings during reordering) or have very similar ratings. However, if they have similar ratings, it is highly likely that the genre combo is not found in all title types. We primarily see that the videogame title type tends towards a lower weighted rating whereas tvEpisode and tvSeries tends towards a higher weighted rating. This may be because TV Series/Episodes in comparison to say movies have more time to tell stories and captivate the audience. Movie steadily tends to stay in the middle of all other title types for ratings. Looking deeper at the ‘Drama’ genres, we see more combinations with Thriller/Horror and Reality-TV at the bottom (lower weighted ratings) in comparison to Documentary or History at the top of the graph. Looking back at plot 5.2.1 we can wee that these other genres have overall lower or higher ratings respectively, especially given that they have similar amounts of work. 5.2.4 Comparing Title Types Based on Ratings and Total Votes In order to look deeper into the distributions of title types. We have made a parallel coordinate diagram. Here we can interactively compare title types, genres, total votes for each distribution, and weighted averages. Each axis can be dragged to different locations, i.e. axis can switch places. Clicking and dragging in a certain area will select a set of points encompassed in the location which the mouse was dragged. The highest of the ratings seem to come from tv types, i.e.: “tvEpisode, tvMiniSeries, and tvSeries”. Most works congregate towards the lower end of the total votes category. By selecting the upper half of the total votes axis, we see that every one of the potential outliers in total votes come from the movie type. Movie works typically have weighted averages lying in the 6-8 range. Not single work within the Drama category seems to have a weighted rating above 9. This title type has the largest variance for number of votes. Short has a very low variance for total votes as all of the works are congregated towards the lower set of votes. There are some short works that have amazing ratings, however, most tend to stay between 6-8. There are very few works in the dataset for tvShort, tvSpecial, and videogame types. 6.. There is a subset of “Drama” combo genres for each title type that has no works, according to the dataset. However it is hard to distinguish the difference between these genre combos. 5.3 Best Director-Writer Pairings 5.3.1 Comparing best Director-Writer Pairs over work ratings We have plotted the above graph to visualize the weighted average ratings distribution of top 10 pairs of director and writer that have worked together for the most of the times. For each director-writer pair, the individual ridges shows the spread of the weighted average ratings of different title types they have worked together. The following are the basics results we interpret from the graph above: 1. The director-writer pair “n59-n” have worked together in shortMovie, Movie, tvEpisode, video and videoGame. Amongst all the title types, the pair has the highest weighted average rating for movies. The mean of the weighted average ratings for movies is approximately 9.2. This suggest that the movies of the pair “n59-n” are more liked by the audience. 2. The director-writer pair “n57-n” have worked together in shortMovie, tvEpisode, and tvSeries. The pair seems to be famous for its tvSeries as we can see that the distribution of the weighted average rating for tvSeries is spread towards the higher end compared to other title types and has the mean of around 7.5 ratings. 3. The pair “n44-n” is observed to make only tvSeries or tvEpisodes. Visualizing the graph we can say that the pair is more likely famous for tvSeries as their weighted average rating spread extends above 9. 4. Interestingly, the pair “n43-n” only produces tvEpisode having a mean rating of 9.5 that is the highest amongst all the top 10 pairs of director and writer. This suggest that the tvEpisodes of this pair are more liked by the people compared to the tvEpisodes released by other pairs. 5. The pair ”n37-n” has worked together for tvSeries and tvEpisodes. From the graph we interpret that the particular pair is more liked by audience when they work together for a tvEpisode. 6. The pair “n3006-n” is also seen to have worked together only for tvEpisodes. The mean of these tvEpisodes are nearly 6.8 ratings. 7. The pair “n3005-n” have worked together for different shortMovies, tvSeries, video and tvEpisodes. Amongst all the titleType, the pair is more liked by the audience for the video content that they release. The mean of their weighted average rating distribution is approximately 7.5 ratings. 8. The pair “n13-n” seems to have worked for titleType tvEpisode, video, tvSeries, and movie. Amongst all the titleType we can say that the pair is most famous for the tvEpisode. This pair is observed to produce the least liked video content compared to video content produced by other pairs. 9. The pair “n11-n” is noticed to have worked for tvEpisode, tvSeries, and movie types of contents. Amongst all the titleTypes this pair worked on, they are most rated for the tvEpisodes. 10. The pair “n0-n” have only worked together to create tvEpisodes. Moreover, the mean of their tvEpisodes is 6.6 ratings. 5.3.2 Which director-writer pairs had the most votes We have plotted the above graph to visualize the number of votes received for different title types released by each director writer pairs that have worked more than 5 times together and had produced contents of weighted average rating equal to 10. 1. For the titleType short we can see clearly that the pair “64-n” has the highest number of votes. Although, all the pairs have received the an average rating 10 but the most likely pair for the titleType short is “n64-n”. 2. For the titleType tvEpisode we observe that there are plenty of pairs that have worked together for this content type. Out of all the pairs, we observe that “n37-n” has the highest number of votes , that is approximately 87.5 votes. Moreover, the pair “n10640878-n10640878” also seem to have similar trend of likening among the audience. 3. Interestingly, among all the available pairs above, the only the pair that have worked together to release the titleTypes of tvMiniSeries and tvSeries is “n113-n”. 4. Similarly, for tvSpecial, we noticed that there is only 1 pair of director-writers who have worked more than 5 times and produced a 10 rated content of this titleType. This pair is “n18-n” and they have received around 20 number of votes. 6. For the titleType video there are 5 pairs of director-writer that have worked together more than 5 times and gained 10 ratings. Amongst all the pairs, the pair “n3195-n” has the highest number of Votes which is approximately 100.

We wanted to compare how each title type’s ratings has changed over time. Especially as one of our inferences was that the difference between older title types vs newer title types and how they are received in today’s generation may change what the ratings look like. Therefore the above component shows a scatterplot displaying the weighted ratings of different works over time. 6.3 Usage The above component was built using D3 v6. The dropdown menu at the top can be used to pick a specific title type. The plot will change to show works within that specific title type.

With the progress of time, the number of adult titles that were produced by the director started increasing, Though, this trend was not of a continuous increasing one but it is observed that as compared to very early years, the number of adult title types releasing increased. Thus, we can conclude that we progressing time and generations, people started likening media content that had some adult content and the society was more open to such entertainment content as compared to the old times. 2. The surprising insight that we got from this question is that the proportion of the number of votes received by non adult title types were still very large as compared to the proportion of number of votes received by the adult type in any given year in the dataset. Although, more adult title types started releasing over time but it is concluded that people were more tend to give votes for movies, TV series, videos, etc that were non adult in nature rather than voting for the adult media types. 7.1.2 Objective Question 2 The largest number of observations come from the movie and tv title types. This may be because there is a larger market for TV series and movies due to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. Many of these works are therefore marketed at a global scale. As stated before, we saw that there are more votes for tv related title types rather than movies. This may be due to the considerable time that an audience member would invest to understand and watch a series or an episode. There is more room for the audience member to grow attached to the characters and see their development. This also leads to higher quality works in the market. Short films on the other hand may be more local with less well known artists. may have trouble getting publicity. Game shows are less popular amongst the youngest generation which may cause them to lose a large number of votes. Video game types are most likely only watched by those who play video games rather than the general public. 7.1.3 Objective Question 3 For the titleTypes of tvMiniSeries, tvSeries, and tvSpecial, there is only 1 pair of director-writer who have an average rating of 10 and have worked together for more than 5 times. The titleTypes short, tvEpisodes, and video have many director-writer pairs that have average rating 10 and have worked for more than 5 times together. Surprisingly, the plot reveals that there is no pair of director-writer that have worked together for more than 5 years and achieved an overall average rating of 10 for the titleType movies, this suggests that there could be two scenarios for this: first there would be pairs that have average rating of 10 but the pair might have worked for less than 5 times or second there could be no movies that have average ratings of 10. 7.2 Limitations Our largest setback was in dealing with the large scale of the data. We wanted to look at different directors and analyze more trends in what/who seems to bring in the highest votes and ratings. However, the large amount of directors slowed down our work immensely and made it difficult for us to plot in a readable fashion. 7.3 Future Directions The IMDb dataset has a names dataset that contains the first, second, and tertiary professions or the individuals listed in the database. It would interesting to look deeper into how the professions of an individual can change their impact on a work, i.e., comparing the average ratings of individuals who have experience as directors and writers vs directors and actors. Another dataset in the database had spatial data that would have been useful in seeing trends in how different title types are received based on location.
