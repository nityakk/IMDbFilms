2. What is the distribution of the average ratings for different genres? Furthermore, for the highet rated genre, how does its average ratings vary from one title type to another?<br/>
3. For top 10 pairs of directors and writers who have worked most of the time with each other, how does the weighted average rating for different title types that they have produced? Moreover, for the director-writer pairs who have worked more than 5 times together and have produced content with a weighted average rating of 10, what is the trend in the distribution of number of votes that they received for their different title types such as videos, TV series, shorts, and others.
