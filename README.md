# Analysis of various films on IMDb
___

This project attempts to answer questions about movie titles found in the IMDb Database. Specifically:

1. Over the time period given in the dataset, did more adult titles start releasing? Are the number of votes for adult titles greater than the number of votes for non-adult titles?
2. How does average ratings per number of votes vary for different works by the same director?
3. What is the correlation between the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd primary professions of the individuals in the names table?


## Dataset
We are be using the [IMDb Datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ "IMDb Dataset") for our final group project. These datasets are updated on a daily basis. They are also quite dense and contain both categorical and continuous variables.
