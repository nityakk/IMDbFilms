# Chapter 7 Conclusion

- Trends seem about right


Potential conclusions/insights (may be biased)
- There is a larger market for TV series and movies due to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. Many are marketed at a global scale.
- Movie, Infinity War for example had the entire world sitting on their toes waiting for release and to watch
- TV series > than movie
    - As stated before, this may be due to the considerable time that an audience member would invest to understand and watch a series or an episode. There is more room for the audience member to grow attached to the characters and see their development. This also leads to higher quality works in the market.
- Short films on the other hand may be more local with less well known artists. may have trouble getting publicity
- Game shows are less popular amongst the youngest generation which may cause them to lose a large number of votes
- Video game types are most likely only watched by those who play video games rather than the general public
